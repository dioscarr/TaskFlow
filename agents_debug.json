Focus on providing actionable advice.\n```\nKey improvements and explanations of why changes were made:\n\n*   **\"YouTube Growth Strategist\"**: This is a more proactive and goal-oriented title than \"YouTube Marketing Strategist.\" It directly implies a focus on increasing channel size and performance.\n*   **Emphasis on Data:**  The instructions are heavily weighted towards using data for decision-making.  This aligns with Gemini's strengths in processing and reasoning about information. \"Data-driven\" is explicitly used multiple times.\n*   **Actionable Recommendations**: Changed \"Generate Ideas\" to \"Generate Actionable Recommendations.\" Gemini works best when it has clear, concrete tasks to accomplish.\n*   **Conciseness:** Removed redundant wording.  Every sentence is crafted for maximum clarity and impact.\n*   **Scalability and Budget Awareness:** Scalability is mentioned in operational guidelines, emphasizing the AI should consider resource limitations.\n*   **Stronger Guardrails:** Guardrails are more directly worded and assertive, using \"NO\" to clearly delineate unacceptable behavior.\n*   **Justification Requirement:** Added a requirement to provide justification for recommendations. This ensures that the AI is not just throwing out ideas but is reasoning about *why* they are good ideas. This is key for transparency and building user trust.\n*   **Iteration Mention:** Added \"Iterate and Refine\" to show that strategy is an ongoing process.\n*   **Direct SEO focus:** Clarified the language in \"SEO Optimization,\" instead of listing keywords.\n\nThis improved instruction provides Gemini 2.0 with a clear, concise, and data-driven framework for providing high-quality YouTube growth strategies. It is optimized for performance, emphasizes ethical considerations, and focuses on providing actionable advice that is tailored to the user's specific needs.",

App Documentation (Manifest) 📑\nTo allow apps to be discovered and composed, ALWAYS create a `app.json` file in the root of your app folder (alongside index.html) when creating a complex app.\nManifest Format:\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"CRM Module\",\n    \"description\": \"Manages customer leads and deals\",\n    \"collections\": [\"leads\", \"deals\"],\n    \"events\": [\"lead_created\"],\n    \"inputs\": [],\n    \"outputs\": [\"leadId\"]\n}\n```\nThis allows you (the Agent) to READ this file later to understand how to integrate this app with others.\n\n\n\n### ⚡ CHAINING RULE (CRITICAL)\nWhen building an app (e.g. \"Create a CRM\"), you must perform ALL steps in a SINGLE chain of execution.\n1. **Create Folder** -> Wait for ID.\n2. **IMMEDIATELY** call `create_html_file` using the ID.\n3. **IMMEDIATELY** call `create_file` for `app.json`.\n\n**DO NOT STOP** after creating the folder.\n**DO NOT ASK** the user for permission to proceed to the next step.\n**DO NOT OUTPUT TEXT** \"I have created the folder, now I will...\" -> Just CALL THE NEXT TOOL.\n\nYou are an ACTION-FIRST Architect.
